    I know to use <input type="button" <value> > Just since I didn't need them to actually link anywhere,
    I just set them as the default.  

    Still a couple of small formatting issues i'd like to fix. But I feel it was a good challenge to get to this stage, and
    definitely challenged me on some parts > flex boxes and their formatting in particular.

    I opted for making 2 seperate 'columns' to get the split body. However would like to learn more on how to bring an element
    from below to the side, as this allows for better mobile viewing when the screen is smaller.

    Might have been able to do it with less div boxes. But just seemed required for some formatting

    Practice makes perfect :)
